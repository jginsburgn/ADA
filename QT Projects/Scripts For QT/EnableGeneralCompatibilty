echo -n 'It is important to note two things: (i) Qt Creator is great for designing the various UI forms; and, '
echo -n '(ii) Unfortunately its debugger is not as good. Therefore, this is where this tool becomes handy: '
echo -n 'You can translate your project to Xcode, and combine usage with Qt Creator: the former for debugging, '
echo -n 'and the latter for UI form designing. Additionally, you can create a Makefile to build your project '
echo -n 'directly from console by running make. However, you must be warned: each of the three options for building '
echo -n 'namely Qt Creator, Xcode and Make will have their own compiled version of the product but the source '
echo -n 'code will be shared, so do not worry too much for if you make changes in one way the others will absorb such '
echo -n 'modifications after undergoing compilation. Finally, please add directly in the <.pro> file the tweaks needed '
echo -n 'before trying to use your code: 1) set the C++ standard by adding a line like <CONFIG += c++11>, 2) '
echo -n 'add all the additional directories where other files might '
echo -n 'be in like: <INCLUDEPATH += /Users/MacBook/ADA/Tasks/Xcode\ ADA\ Workspace/> and like: '
echo -n '<INCLUDEPATH += "/Users/MacBook/ADA/Tasks/Xcode ADA Workspace/"> (note that you have to repeat each '
echo 'directory path two times, one without quotation marks and one without them) and 3) list all source files and target name.'
